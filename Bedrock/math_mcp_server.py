Math MCP Server

This module implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides mathematical
capabilities to AI assistants. The server exposes tools for basic arithmetic operations,
prompts for mathematical assistance, and resources for configuration and greetings.

Features:
- Mathematical tools: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Prompts: math assistant and system prompts for AI interactions
- Resources: personalized greetings and application configuration

The server runs via stdio and can be integrated with MCP-compatible AI systems
to extend their mathematical reasoning capabilities.
